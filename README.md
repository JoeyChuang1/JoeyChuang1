- ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, welcome to my GitHub.
-I'm Joey Chuang, a passionate software engineering student in my 4th year at McGill University. With 3 software engineering internships and 2 lab research assistant positions under my belt, I actively pursue projects that align with my interests in AI , particularly NLP and reinforcement learning. You can find some of my projects on this topic below. My love for software engineering extends beyond AI, and I've built various full-stack projects to showcase my well-rounded skillset. Feel free to reach out to me at joeychuangwork@gmail.com to connect!
